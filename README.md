Code and simulation data for Ye &amp; Sugihara 2016
"Information leverage in interconnected ecosystems: Overcoming the curse of dimensionality"
Science 353, Issue 6302, pp. 922-925

## Notes
* This is a raw dump of the data files and R code. It should be complete w.r.t. to the analyses and figures in the paper (+/- minor touch-up of the figures in Illustrator)
* See `main.R` for the control script which goes through all the steps of generating data, running the analyses, and creating the figures.
* Other script files contain function definitions that are referred to in `main.R`
* I'm not sure what all the miscellaneous files are -- some may be remnants leftover from experimental excursions, or backups of code before revisions for the paper.
